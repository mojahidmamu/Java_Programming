    => Polymorphism means "many forms"
    => It allows one action to behave differently based on the project.

2. In Java, polymorphism is mainly of two types:
    i. Compile-time Polymorphism (Static) → Achieved by Method Overloading: 
        =>  When a class has multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, 
            it is overloading.

    ii. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic) → Achieved by Method Overriding
        => When a child class provides a new version of a method already defined in the parent class,
           it is overriding.
