1. Defination: 
    => Inheritance means one class can acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and variables) of another class.
    => It helps in code reusability and methods overriding.
    ### Example: 
    => A Child inherits features from its Parent â€” like eyes, hair color, etc.
    ** in JAVA: 
    => The Parent class called Super class, (Base class);
    => The Child class called Sub class, (Derived class);
