1. What is class?
=> A class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects.

*** It defines:
=> Variables (data) â€” also called fields or attributes
=> Methods (functions) â€” define behavior
=> Think of a class as a design and an object as a real thing made from that design

2. What is an Object?
=> An object is a real-world entity that has:
=> State (data/attributes)
=> Behavior (methods/functions)
***For example:
    ðŸ“˜ Class = Car
    ðŸš— Object = Toyota, BMW, Tesla, etc.

=> Each object has its own data (like color, speed) but shares the same structure defined by the class.
